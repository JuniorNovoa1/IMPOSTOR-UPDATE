Minecraft Movie Script:
*the movie begins on a book with the text “Minecraft” being visible.*
Narrator #1:Everyone has been familiar with the popular video game classic, minecraft.
Narrator #2: An innocent game such as this would not have such dark origin? Right?
Narrator #1: However, this is not the case.
*the book opens to a picture of Notch and another person, though their face is scratched out*
Narrator #1: This begins with the friendships of Notch and Brine, two brothers, long before 1.15. Many people around the world are familiar with the evil spirit known as herobrine, but this was not the truth.w
* the camera transitions to a building in the real world*
Narrator #2: It’s the year 2007, when Notch and his friend Brine have been developing on a little game they called Minecraft. 
*Zooms into the building*
Notch: Brine! I’ve finished the first alpha version of Minecraft!-
Brine: No way! You’re actually done!
Notch: Yes! And as you are my brother, you have the honor to be the first to test Minecraft!
 Narrator #1: But as they soon find out, this would go south fairly quickly.
*Notch and Brine enter*
Notch; The game has been set up for you! You could even enter your own name! Try it!
*Notch and Brine both sit down as Brine types in for his character, Herobrine.
*The computer shows footage of Brine playing Minecraft*
Brine: Wow. I’ve got to hand it to you, you’ve done a great job on this game!
Notch: Oh but I have more plans for the future of this game! Yes, it may take a good decade or so, but I think we’ll… Brine?
*Pans to Brine not paying any attention*
Notch: BRINE!
Brine: Huh? Wha? Sorry, it was a little… addicti… distracted! I was uh… distracted.
Notch: Eh, fine I’ll tell you later, I’ve gotta take a call. I’ll be right back.
*Notch leaves the room*
Brine: God.. what just happened?
Narrator #2: Brine didn’t know that his addiction to this little game would soon lead to his…
Narrator #1: DEATH.
*Cuts to a shot of Brine in his house on the phone*
Brine: Im telling you Notch, stop worrying. With a game that good, it's sure to be a hit.----- Ok well I’ll talk to you later
Brine: Notch may be great at coding, but he is blind when it comes to seeing his own talent. The game he made is just, so good!
*Brine takes Mac and Cheese out of the microwave and walks over to his couch*
 Brine: I just can’t stop thinking about Notch’s game, I just wish I could play it more.
*Cuts to Notch brushing his teeth*
*Noise come from down stairs*
Notch: What was that?
*Notch puts down his tooth brush and walks downstairs*
*He sees Brine on his computer*
Notch: Hello? Brine is that you? What are you doing in my house?
*Brine doesn't respond*
Notch: BRINE!
Brine: huh...oh...hey.
Notch: WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE!
Brine: Oh ya, I just playing your game, it's really good. 
Notch: BUT YOU BROKE INTO MY HOUSE!
Brine: So what do you care? You don’t even like your game. You don't see it like I do.
Notch: Ya but its my house, and my game.
Brine: OH REALLY?! WELL..UM...I WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE YOU THE IDEA OF THE GAME! SO I DESERVE SOMETHING, YOU GET ALL THE GLORY!
Notch: BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN COME INTO MY HOUSE!
Brine: WELL MAYBE IF YOU LET ME HELP WITH THE GAME THIS WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED. AND BESIDES YOUR WIFI IS AMAZING. AND WE’RE BROTHERS!
Notch: WELL YOU DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO CODE! YOU’RE A MADMAN BRINE!
Brine: YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE!, I DON'T NEED YOUR DUMB GAME ANYWAYS!
*Brine storms out*
Notch: What was up with him…
*Cuts to Brine back at home*
Brine: *mumbling to himself* oh...what are you doing in my house, its my game. I should have though no better form someone like him. 
Brine: I don’t need his game, it's boring anyway.
Narrator #1: Despite what he may say…
Narrator #2: He can not overcome his obsession.
*A couple days pass*
 *Cuts to a scene of Brine working in a dark room at a desk*
Brine: Yes…it's finally done
Brine: Oh… this will show him how much of a “Madman” I really am…
*Evil Laughing*
*Cut to tomorrow, 12:34 am*
Brine: Now, if I am very careful, I could transport my physical form into code, and transport myself into the video game! Yes!
*Brine starts up the machine, sparks flying left and right as the room around him begins to shake, and objects start crashing down, but soon enough, he has transported himself into minecraft.”
*Switches to Notch at home, sitting in his kitchen*
Notch: Man I feel kinda bad for yelling at Brine like that, maybe I should talk to him.
*Notch picks up his phone, it rings for a second, then switched to voicemail*
Phone: Please leave a message after the beep, *BEEP*
Notch: Weird, he didn’t pick up, maybe he is really that mad at me, I guess I’ll just go to his house
*Notch outside Brine’s house*
*Notch knocks on the door*
Notch: Hello?!
*The door falls on the ground/creeks open*
Notch: Well that's odd…
Notch: Hello?
Notch: HELLO?!
*Notch walks into the house*
Notch: Hello? Brine are you there?
*Notch walks through the house, things are scattered everywhere*
Notch: What happened here?
*Notch walks upstairs*
Notch: Brine, are you there?
*walks into Brine’s room, things are scattered everywhere*
Notch: Brine..,
*Walks over to desk, a large minecraft cube is sitting on the desk, emitting small sparks*
Notch: Brine...what's going on? This isn't funny Brine*
*Notch looks at the computer on the desk, minecraft is on the screen, the game is moving yet he can see no one at the computer*
*Small text says “Herobrine Left The Game” on the side of the screen, then the computer shuts down*
*Dramatic music*




Adventures of Steve
Steve as a narrator: This, *shows image of a person, steve* is me. I’m a new recruit at the mojang team, and today is my first day to experience their game that a developer there has been making for quite some time! I was just giddy! I said, I WAS GIDDY.

*Steve enters the front part of the studio and is in great awe.*
Steve: Dam- Dang! This place is huuuuge! I think I’m gonna love it here!
*Steve walks into Mojang*
Steve: Ok, first order of business, I have to find my office, then I got to get to work.
*Steve goes to his office*
Steve: Great, now I have to get things set up, then I can get to work.
*Sees a post-it note on the desk*
Steve: Huh, what is this?
*Picks up the post-it and reads it*
Steve: “Meet me in my office, -Notch” Oh, alright then.
*Cuts back to steve walking to a business room*
Steve: Hello? Are you notch? The person I was uh… suppose to meet?
*a figure in a chair turns around to reveal not notch, but a mysterious person who works at Mojang.*
Mojang worker: Oh, notch isn't here today, he’s… been sick…
*Mojang worker stands up and walks towards steve*
*Sticks out hand for a hand shake*
Mojang worker: Daniel, Daniel Frisk.
Steve: Steve, Steve Spelare.
*They both exchange firm hands shakes*
Daniel: Here, come with me, steve.
Daniel: It’s not much, we just want to see if people like you, or the public, will think about this game! I’ve gotta take a call so, just give it a try!
*Steve and david both walk to a room with a bright computer screen with the words, Minecraft.
Steve: This is the game I play?
Daniel: Yep! Just be careful of a new experimental item we added, called an enchanted golden apple. *pulls out picture of enchanted golden apple* Avoid this, it's a little buggy and glitched out.
Steve: Oh okay, so I can start?
Daniel: Yep! Take as much time as you need!
*Daniel leaves the room, steve walks over to the desk and presses play. Steve enters in the name CoolDude11, but doesn’t work and automatically changes to Steve.*
Steve: Ok.... what's going on? Does it have to be my real name? This is du-
*Before steve could finish his thought, the computer starts smoking and shaking violently*
Steve: Huh?
*Steve starts to get sucked into the computer*
Steve: HEY! UH! HELP! PLEASE! I'M TOO YOUNG TO IIIIIIIIIIII-
*Steve doesn’t die, but is transported into minecraft*
Steve: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaahhh… ah? Why is everything, blocky? What is going on!?
*text pops up Herobrine joined the game*
Steve: Uh? Hello? How do I talk to you, Herobrine? 
* a black rectangle appears with a blinking line at the far left, above is the same text Herobrine joined the game*
Steve: Hello?
*The word hello appears in the black rectangle, and it sends through.*

Steve in text box: Woah, yeah, I just got transported into this cursed game, can you help me out, are you the god of this place?
*No one responds* 
Steve: Yo? Hellllooooo? Nevermind, I’ll find a way out myself…
*Steve starts walking around the colorful blocky world in awe.*
Steve: Maybe to get out of the game, I have to beat it, I guess that makes sense.
 *He notices a tree*
*Taps it and it starts to break*
Steve: Woah. *He breaks the tree*
Steve: Oh, and I turn the wood into planks, and I make a crafting device, and I can, oh, make tools.
*Steve makes wooden tools*
Steve: Well i guess the next step is probably to collect stone.
*Notices a dark cave, dramatic noises play*
*Steve takes out his sword and approaches the cave*
Steve: Well I guess they don’t call it MINE-craft for nothing. Hehe. *sigh*
*Steve runs into the cave*
*Steve approaches a dark ore and mines it*
Steve: Well if I combine this with the sticks, I get, Aha!
*Steve places a torch*
Steve: Well this won’t be to hard
*Steve journeys deeper and finds iron*
Steve: Well I cant use this, but if I make a furnace, I can smelt it into ingots. Wow this game is easy!
*Steve make an iron (thing) and travels deeper*
*When steve places another torch, a zombie appears in the light*
Steve: AHHHHH, WHAT THE HECK!
*He backs away, and gets shot by an arrow*
Steve: Ow, what the heck is going on!
*A bunch of zombies appear, and arrows shoot out of the darkness*
*Steve runs out of the cave*
*Steve leaves the cave and sees some pigs*
Steve: Man, I’m hungry.
*Pig comes in to view*
*Steve pulls out a sword ands kills it*

*Steve eats one raw porkchop*
Steve: *nom nom* ewh.
*Steve places a furnace and cooks the food*
*Eats the cooked porkchop*
Steve: Yum! Finally, some good food.
*Picks up furnace and starts to adventure, and walks through many biomes*
*Days pass*
*Steve finds a village*
*Steve enter the village and walks around, the villagers look at awe at him, but hide away*
*Steve walks up to a villager*
Steve: Hello!
Villager: A player? We haven’t seen one like you in awhile!
Steve: Huh, oh ya I guess! You know how I can get out of this game?
Villager: Leave? To where?
Steve: Ehh, not important, but do you know where I can find herobrine? I think he may have what I need.
Villager: *gasps* *whispers “come with me”*
*Villager runs inside, steve follows*
*villager looks out the windows and checks the street, noone is there*
Villager: We don’t like to talk about him here
Steve: What do you mean?
Villager: We don’t know where he came from or what he wants, but Herobrine is powerful force here. It is rumored that he created this into world that he lives, and can create and destroy blocks at will, it is said that he lives in a castle he built in a strange dimension known as the nether, and he is protected by legions of monsters. He is not a man you want to mess with.
Steve: When I came here, he said Hi to me, but then he left. I think he might be the reason I am here.
Villager: The last time a player came through here, which was years ago, he told me a similar story.
Steve: Weird. Well I have to find him, I think he is the only way for me to get home.
Villager: *sighs* You sound like the last player…
Villager: Well, we do know one way to get to the nether, but it won't be easy. 
Villager: First of all, we are going to need the tools to fight.
Steve: Well how do we get those?
Villager: From the mine *zooms in on mine* *dramatic music*
Steve: No, no, nope definitely not
Villager: It's the only way…
Steve: There has to be another way! Do you know whats down there, we’ll die!
Villager: Stop being such a cry baby. It isn't that bad if you know what you are doing.
Steve: Well I don't know what I am doing
Villager: Why do you think I am here?!
Steve: You’ll teach me?
Villager: YES!
Steve: Thank you!
Villager: Yeah yeah yeah. Let's get going. *walks off screen*
Villager: First, we will need the tools.
*Villager shows Steve a chest, Steve gets a pickaxe out of it*
VIllager: Next we will need armor!
*Villager shows Steve anoter chest, Steve gets out an iron Chestplate and helmet*
*Steve puts on the armor*
Villager: Ok we are ready to go!
*Dramatic scene of Steve all geared up*
Steve: I'm ready!
*Steve and Villager in the cave*
Villager: The dangers you may face here are zombies, undead monsters that try to eat your brains, skeletons, creatures that use bows to shoot you, creepers, strange creatures that will try to blow themselves up around you, and finally, Enderman, tall, slender creatures that can teleport around, but they won’t try to kill you unless you look at them.
Steve: Great…
Villager: But if you light the caves with torches, hostile mobs won't spawn.
*Villager walks into the darkness and places a torch*
Villager: If you see anything in the stone, it is probably an ore, so mine it
Steve: Ok
Villager: Ok let's go exploring
*Montage of them exploring and finding, coal, iron, lapis, gold, and redstone
*Montage ends on a shot of a diamond, Steve walks into the room*
Steve: Oh look, another ore
Villager: Diamonds!
Steve: What?
Villager: That is the most valuable and rarest ore in the game! You can use it to craft the most powerful tools and armor!
Steve: Wow, that’s pretty cool! It sounds like something we will definitely need.
*Steve approaches the diamonds and starts mining it*
*A diamond comes out of the ore*
Steve: shiny. 
*4 more blocks of diamond ore are inside the stone wall*
Villager: I see four more diamonds inside.
*Steve mines all blocks and stores all the shiny blue gems inside his inventory*
*Steve and Villager explore the caves and find more materials in a really cool montage*
Steve: Wow! We got lots of ores!
VIllager: Indeed, but I think that will be enough for now.
*The villager and Steve walk back up to the entrance of the cave*
 *A sound is heard nearby* *dramatic music starts up*
Villager: oh no, it’s one of them…
Steve: Um… what do you mean one of the-
*Steve does not finish his sentence because a black tall figure with skinny arms jumps out onto the grass path*
Villager: Quick! Look away!
*the villager looks down, but Steve does notth*
Steve: I don’t see one!
Villager: Don’t look at the thing-
*it was too late, the enderman saw Steve get a good glimpse of it, it screeches and chases after Steve*
Steve: My ears! HELP! I DON’T WANT TO DIE!
*the villager thinks quickly, crafting a bucket and filling it up with water from a nearby pond*
Steve: HELP AHHH! HE’S ATTACKING ME!
Villager: I got something!
*villager pours water all over the enderman, causing him to scream and screech, before teleporting away and behind the villager.*
VIllager: umm…. heh?
*enderman slaps the villager which causes him to slide near a ravine*
Steve: NO STOP IT.
*steve places down a crafting table and quickly crafts a diamond sword*
*the villager tries to grab more water from a nearby cave stream, but the enderman slaps the bucket down the ravine and into a pool of lava down below. The enderman turns back to the villager, making loud irritating screeches*
Villager: I guess this is the end for me- *dramatic music is getting more intense*
*the enderman lets out a screech as it dies, with a diamond sword stabbing it. A bunch of purple particles float out of it's wound before falling onto the ground* *dramatic music stops*
Steve: *huffing and puffing* What. The hell. Was that? And why was it so… AWESOME?!
Villager: Wow, that was awe-
*The villager next to the ravine falls in, as the villager screams.* 
Villager: AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Steve: NO! 
Villager: Wow, you sure do know something about how to fight.
*villager gets up (without falling into the ravine like fool)*
Steve: That was exciting. 
*a shiny black pearl is left on the ground, where the enderman died, steve picks it up*
Steve: What the heck is this supposed to be.
Villager: It’s an ender pearl, teleports the user to where it was thrown, those things are quite hard to get. The village cleric is rich enough to somehow to obtain a good load of those pearls. 
*sun rises in the distance as they walk out of the cave*
Villager: we should go back to the village.
*both of our heroes head up to the village, a burning zombie is seen nearby but dies before it gets to them*
Steve: So where are we going? Wait, what is that?
*both Steve and the Villager stop in their tracks. Steve is pointing towards an obsidian structure*
VIllager: The nether portal, some blocks are missing.
*the obsidian blocks form the shape of a rectangle, but several blocks are missing. Vines are seen on the blocks, clearly showing its very old*

Villager: No one knows how it got there, many think herobrine once used it to get to the nether, but now it lays abandoned. However, a villager once repaired the portal and traveled through, thats how we know most of our knowledge on the Nether.
Steve: What happened to him?
Villager: When he came back through, he brought back the most dangerous mobs back, they wrecked havoc over the village, before being put down the full force of several iron golems.
Steve: what are thos-
*iron golem walks by*
Villager: that thing.
Steve: oh ok.
Villager: Now that you have a diamond sword, we can enchant it, as well with another diamond tool that you can craft.
Steve: Enchant?
Villager: I’ll explain later.
*both walk over into the Library*
*Cuts to room full of villagers*
Villager #1: We have called this meeting to discuss the arrival of the new player
Villager #2: WE WANT HIM OUT! THOSE PLAYERS BING NOTHING BUT BAD LUCK!
*Cheering*
Villager #1: Now settle down there, I doubt he will be around for long.
Villager #3: Thats what you said last time, and our whole village was nearly destroyed when he opened that portal!
*More Cheering*
Villager #1: Well maybe this-
Villager #2: IF YOU WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, WE WILL TAKE MATTER INTO OUR OWN HANDS!!!!
*Cheering*
*Dramatic Music*
*Cuts back to villager and steve in the library*
*The villager hits a hidden lever, and some books part, revealing an enchanting table, bookshelves surround the table*
Steve: Woah what is this?
Villager: An ancient artifact uncovered by the villager librarians not too long ago where the old builders used to reside in.
*villager pulls out a book from a nearby bookshelf*
Villager(reads from book): place your sword on top of the book.
*steve follows his directions, an overview of many symbols appear*
Steve: WOAH, I can’t read anything on there, except for the numbers and what the heck? What on earth is Sharpness IV?
Villager: according to the characters, it reads you must be level 30-
Steve: Hey it says I’m level 33!
Villager: Okay, choose your enchantment of choice.
Steve: Sharpness IV sounds good.
*villager pulls out lapis, uses it on the enchantment table, enchanting sound plays*
Steve: woah, the sword is shiny.
*Steve examines a sword, and a blue box pops up, showing the words in blue font: Sharpness IV and Unbreaking III*
Villager: Yes. Your sword will now deal more damage to your enemies.
Steve: Cool!
Villager: anyways, to go to the nether you need obsidian, but it can only be mined with a diamond pickaxe. 
Steve: oh ok
*steve walks to a nearby crafting table, and a 3x3 box pops up*
Steve: so I’m assuming I put 3 diamonds on the top and two sticks vertically below it.
*steve does what he just said, a diamond pickaxe appears in a box to the right of the 3x3 grid, steve grabs it*
Steve: woah, I should enchant this one too
Villager: here grab some more lapis
*Steve grabs the lapis and goes to the enchanting table, he places the pickaxe on the book*
Steve: I see Efficiency IV at the bottom.
*steve inserts lapis, and the book closes, the pickaxe starts to shine, steve grabs it*
Steve: It says it has Efficiency IV and fortune III
*blue box tells Steve the info appears
Villager: Now your pickaxe will mine through blocks faster and gives more materials through mining, which is very important 
Steve: Cool
Villager: Now you can craft armor to protect you from dangers
*Steve crafts diamond armor*
*Steve enchants the armor*
Steve: Protection!
*Steve enchants the helmet*
Villager: That will protect minimize the damage from mobs
Steve: Blast Protection!
*Steve enchants the chestplate*
Villager: That will protect you from explosions
Steve: Fire Protection!
*Steve enchants pants*
Villager: That will protect you from fire damage
Steve: Feather Falling
*Steve enchants the boots*
Villager: That will protect you from long falls
*Steve puts on the armor and pulls out the sword*
Villager: Now you are ready!
*Steve and villager appear in a field*
Villager: Now that you have the gear, it is time for you to train
Villager: But first, *villager hands Steve an enchanted bow*, a power V bow, does extra damage to your enemies.
*training montage which includes Steve fighting a dummy, fighting the Villager, and target practice with the bow*
*Steve finally beats the villager in a fight*
Villager: I think you are ready, but for your final test, *cuts to the cave*, you have the get the 4 last pieces of obsidian for the portal, alone.
*dramatic music*
Steve: Dont worry, I’ll only take a second
*steve walks into the cave*
Steve: Ok, I can do this
*Explores the cave by torch light*
Steve: So, all I have to do is find a lava pool, then turn it to obsidian with this water bucket, then mine it. That doesnt seem too hard. 
*Keeps exploring*
*Hears skeleton noises*
Steve: What was that?
*Arrow shoots out of the darkness, narrowly missing him*
*Skelton appears*
*Steve blocks the arrow with a shield then kills the skeleton with his sword*
Steve: Well that wasnt too hard.
*Creeper appears*
Steve: What is that? Oh those must be the creepers he told me about...
Steve: Wait! Creeper!?! Aw ma-
*creeper explodes*
Steve: Ow! 
*Steve gets shot by an arrow*
Steve: Ah!
*Skeleton, creeper, and two zombies appear*
*Steve dodges the arrows and runs towards the group, and starts attacking the zombies*
*The creeper nearly explodes, and steve backs off, and the explosion kills the group, and exposes a lava pool.*
Steve: hey would you look at that!
*steve places the water bucket at the edge of the hole, and the lava turns into obsidian*
*Steve collects the water and  jumps down*
Steve: Right, now I just need to mine the ob- wait, what's that?
*Screeching*
Steve: Oh no, wait.
*Steve pulls out his bow*
Steve: Ha! Take this!
*Shoots an arrow, Enderman teleports and hits steve from behind*
Steve: Argh!
*Steve spins around and pulls out his sword, but the enderman isnt there*
Steve: What?
*Enderman hits him again*
Steve: ARGH!
*Steve starts spinning around, searching the dark room for the enderman, eventually, steve sees it in the corner, seconds later, it starts to run at Steve*
*Just before the enderman hits Steve, Steve hits it with his sword, then the Enderman teleports away*
Steve: Take that!
*Enderman teleports behind Steve, but just before he hits Steve, Steve spins around at kills the enderman*
Steve: Ha! Take that!
*Ender pearl drops on the ground*
*Steve collects it then finishes mining the 4 obsidian*
*Cuts to the villager waiting outside the cave entrance*
*Steve walks out the cave*
Steve: Guess what I have! That’s right! The 4 obsidian!
Villager: Very well. Let’s go back to the village then we can fix that portal first thing in the morning
*Sun sets as they walk into the distance*
*Steve lays on a bed as white pixel words appear, saying “respawn point set”*
*the next day*
Steve: I guess today is the day
*Steve goes and gets his armor and obsidian*
*he grabs a gold carrot and eats it while walking outside with the obsidian and his armor on*
Villager: Ah here you are, I crafted a flint and steel we can use
Steve: Great! Lets get moving.
*Steve and villager head off*
Steve: Finally I can get out of here.
Villager: Where exactly is ‘here’?
Steve: Well your in a g-, you know what it isn't important, but I’m not from this world.
Villager: Oh, ok. What is your world like?
Steve: Oh, a lot less blocky.
Villager: Hmmm, sounds weird.
Steve: You could say that.
*They arrive at the portal*
Villager: Well, we’re here
Steve: Guess this is it. 
Villager: Yep
*Steve rebuilds the portal*
*Villager lights the portal*
*Portal Noises and dramatic stuff, lighting strikes, the sky darkened, stuff like that*
Steve: Ok then *Steve jumps in the portal*
*Villager jumps in the portal*
*Shows the nether, and a portal sits there, lit*
*Steve and villager jump out*
Steve: Woah
Villager: I’ve only heard the stories, I have never been here before…
*Ghast noises*
Steve: What was that?
Villager: DUCK!
*Villager pushes Steve out of the way*
*Explosion*
Steve: WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
Villager: A GHAST!
Steve: Huh?
Villager: Over there!
*Pans to the ghast floating in the air*
Steve: You really need to tell me about these things in advance.
*Ghast shoots fireball, both jump out of the way*
Villager: Use the bow to shoot it down!
Steve: Oh, right. 
*Steve takes out bow, and shoots an arrow, but misses*
*The ghast shoots another fireball, Villager jumps out of the way, but steve gets hit and drops the bow*
Steve: Ow!
Villager: STEVE!
*Villager picks up the bow and shoots down the ghast*
*The Ghast immeddiately falls sideways as it turns more red, then a tear comes out of it's eyes, and falls down to the ground
*The Villager runs over to Steve*
Villager: Are you ok?
Steve: Ya, just got hurt a bit, but good thing I didn't get caught on fire.
Villager: Ya eat this. It will heal you.
*Villager hands Steve a steak, and then he walks over to the ghast tear*
Villager: Hmmmm, I think a might be able to turn this into a potion, I just need some more ingredients, and a place to brew it.
*Villager walks back over to Steve*
Steve: Are there anymore surprises you should tell me about?
Villager: Well unless we find a nether fortress, the only real danger should be ghasts, and all the lava and fire, but look out for there are these Zombie Pigman, but unless you hit them they should be fine
Steve: Ok then, well what now?
Villager: We have to find Herobrine’s fortress.
Steve: Ok, let's go!
Steve:Um...where is that?
Villager: Well...Im not sure...
Steve: WHAT?
Villager: I said I would get you here, I never said I could get you to the fortress!
Steve: Oh.
Villager: Hey, I have plenty of food, so we are in no hurry.
Steve: Ya...we should get looking...
*villager and steve walk by quartz, which shines brightly, catching Steve’s eyes*
Steve: What’s that? 
Villager: It’s quartz, completely useless unless you use it for building. 
*Steve disappears from camera and runs back holding many quartz [villager sighs]*
Steve: Oh look some more quartz
Villager: I thought you were looking for the fortress?
Steve: Oh yea *has more quartz held in his hand again* let’s do that
*the heroes keep on walking while endermen, piglins, and hoglins (if 1.16 came out) walk around in the forests in the background*
*Steve walks under a cave, and comes out on the other side, revealing a broken nether brick bridge residing in front of him*
Steve: *looking up revealing giant nether fortress* What is that?
Villager: Wow! We found a fortress!
Steve: We found herobrine!
Villager: I dont think so...  but we can get some good loot here
Steve: Oh...well whatever, at least it's something.
*Steve quickly mines through the nether brick bridge using his diamond pickaxe and they come out on top, revealing a dark quiet hallway with a chest in fron of them*
Steve: I don’t like this.
Villager: *pokes his head out* wait, the chest, there might be good loot.
Steve: okay I’m going to take a look inside
Villager: Look out for skeletons, Wither skeletons, and blazes!
*Steve walks over and opens the chest, grabbing diamond horse armor, a couple diamonds (5), and one golden apple*
Villager: That’s lucky, you got pretty valuable items.
Steve: Yes I did, but what about those monst-* wait WHAT--!
*A black 3 block tall runs down the hallway right at Steve and the Villager*
Villager: Wither Skeleton!
Steve: Watch OUT!
*the wither skeleton slashes his stone sword but Steve deflects the hit with his diamond sword and thrusts his sword into the skeleton’s black withered ribs*
*The wither skelton dies*
Villager: Ya, well those were the wither skeletons, sort of like normal skeletons but they use swords instead of bows, and they apply a wither affect that eats away your health when they hit you
Steve: Huh
Villager: And blazes are floating monsters of fire that fly around and shoot fireballs at people, but they usually spawn from spawners, that create more and more blazes until broken or exposed to too much light
Steve: Ok, got it.
Villager: Well then, we might as well keep exploring, but watch out for monsters.
Steve: Alright, lets go.
*They continue to explore the Nether Fortress coming across a couple more chests*
*Steve and the Villager walk into room with a small pool of lava in the center*
Steve: Wow! We found some good loot! I think I can craft a diamond chestplate!
*Steve places down a crafting table and makes a diamond chestplate*
Steve: Great! Now I can have even more protection.
Villager: Very nice, let us keep exploring, but can you go first?
Steve: Oh ya, you have nothing do you?
Villager: Yes, but I trust in your abilities.
Steve: You won't have to worry, lets go.
*Steve and Villager leave the room, and continue explore, and after not much time, they come across a room with a flight of stairs in the middle*
*Villager stops and walks to the side, Steve starts walking up the stairs*
*Steve stops and turns around*
Steve: What are you doing?
Villager: There is nether wart over here
*Steve walks over to the villager*
Steve: What is nether wart
Villager: Alone it is pretty much useless, but it prepares water to be able to be turned into powerful potions
*Villager collects nether wart*
Steve: There are potions?
Villager: Yes, and all I need now is a blaze road to make a brewing stand, then I can make some
Steve: Well how do we get that
Villager: We just need to kill a blaze, but I only need one so it wont be that hard
Steve: Ok then lets find one.
*Steve walks up the stairs, Villager follows, at the top, Villager stops and looks around*
Villager: There
Steve: What?
Villager: Over there is a blaze spawner, we should be able to get one from there
Steve: Ok then lets go!
Villager: WAIT!
*Steve continues walking up the stairs, suddenly he collapses on the ground, RED SPY stands behind him. knife in hand*
*TF2 music plays*
THE END
*suddenly, fire charges come straight for steve and the villager, the villager dodges, the same cannot be said for Steve*
Steve: AAAHHHH I’M BURNING
Villager: QUICKLY STOP DROP AND ROLL (EAT FOOD TOO)
Steve: *continues running, trips over bridge* AHHHHHHHHHHH
*Steve falls in lava and dies*
Villager: OH NO!
*blaze appears*
Villager: well-
THE END
Villager: Quickly, EAT food right now!
Steve: OKAY! *steve eats food and stops burning, he proceeds to look up to see-*
Villager: A BLAZE!
*A floating yellow head with burnt marks as some kind of beard with floating blaze rods eyes Steve and the Villager*
Steve: I don’t like the feeling of this!
*the blaze proceeds (makes metallic sounds) to send more fire charges in the direction of Steve and the Villager(who both dodge them this time)*
Steve: LET’S GET HIM! *charges towards the blaze, jumps and does a critical slice*
*blaze makes metallic sounds and uses it's rods to hit steve*
Steve: *proceeds to slice once, twice, and three times, right into the blaze’s rods*
*weakened, the blaze floats down to the ground and tries to escape*
Steve: OH NO YOU DON’T *stabs through the blaze’s head, which turns into smoke and drops one of it's blaze rods*
Villager: WOW, you do have some fighting skills!
Steve: That felt, well, exhiliartating! *picks up blaze rod*
Villger: Good, now I can make a brewing stand
*two more blazes fly out*
Steve: OH NO! THERE’S MORE??!
Villager: Ya, the blaze spawner will keep making more
*a small cage the size of one block contains one mini blaze floating and spinning inside, suddenly, two more blazes spawn around the monster spawner, both of them catch the sight of Steve and the Villager*
Villager: Good thing I saved a little bit of wood and iron *proceeds to take out crafting table while Steve slices down and kills a blaze*
*several fire charges come flaming down onto Steve, who dodges it just in time while an inferno thrives all around the castle*
Villager: HERE, USE THIS *throws a shield near Steve*
Steve: GOT IT! *Steve picks up the shield and catches sight of more fire charges coming in his direction, so he blocks them with his shield*
*the blazes circle toward the villager-*
Steve: NO! *he takes out his Power V bow, and starts to shoot one, which immediately dies and drops a blaze rod near the villager*
*Villager picks up the blaze rod*
Villager: Cover me, I'm going to destroy the spawner
Steve: Alright! *Steve proceeds to shoot two more blazes, one blaze rod dops to the ground-*
*Villager grabs out an iron pickaxe and starts to run to the spawner*
*another blaze spawns*
Villager: OH NOOOOOO!!!!
*Blaze proceeds to shoot a quadrillion (to the power of 9 quadrillion) fire charges at the villager, causing him to immediately to burn into the crisp and end up with “roast bignosed”*
Steve: NOOOOOO wait *proceeds to sniff smell of roast bignosed* that smells good 
*Steve runs over, and starts eating the roast bignosed*
Steve: well, he kinda tastes good, although he was a good ally, I can seriously enjoy “roast bignosed” 
THE END
Steve: GET OUT OF THE WAY! *stabs diamond sword into blaze-*
Blaze: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE *proceeds to shoot a fireball at Steve*
Villager: Watch Out!
Steve: *blocks the fire ball then shoots blaze which immediately dies-*
*Villager destroys the spawner*
Villager: Phew, now that's over *walks over to crafting table*
Villager: Now I can make that brewing stand
*Villager crafts a brewing stand, and places it on top of the crafting table*
*Villager begins to brew a potion*
Villager: I only have a couple materials, so I can only make two potions of regeneration
Steve: Huh, and these potions heal you?
Villager: Yes, but not all at once. Here is one, I’ll keep the other
*Villager drops a potion of regeneration*
Steve: Ok, what’s next?
Villager: Well I have some extra blaze powder, but i guess I can make a couple of eyes of ender. Do you still have the ender pearls?
Steve: Ya
Villager: Give me the ender pearl *Steve holds out pearl, villager grabs it*
Villager: The eye of ender.
Steve: It’s so beautiful-
Villager: Yeah, and we could use it to find a Stronghold, but I don't think we will need to find one, maybe we could use it to find-
*A wither skeleton charges straight towards Steve*
Steve: *runs onto nearby netherrack* NOT AGAIN!
Wither Skeleton: *attempts to slash Steve*
Steve: *deflects slash and stabs the wither skeleton once*
Villager: IT’S ALMOST DEAD!
Steve: *Slashes right through the wither skeleton but accidently hits-
Villager: THE ZOMBIE PIGMAN! WATCH OUT-
*it is too late, the undead pigman screeched in pain, and it turns around to face Steve*
Steve: *proceeds to stab and slash the pigman before it could do anything*
Villager: Oh NO! LOOK LOOK LOOK!
Steve: What is it- HOLY-
*A huge battalion of zombie pigman rush towards the villager and steve, both heroes retreat*
*cuts into intense chase scene for 3 minutes*
Steve and Villager: *jump over gaps and hole, while steve shoots at pigman and kills pigman in the 3 minute duration*
Villager: QUICK! BUILD SOMETHING! *3 minutes have passed*
Steve: GOT IT! *he runs into a 4 way intersection, takes out cobblestone and starts to place many blocks in 2 of the gates, one pigman gets to the villager before Steve blocks off the last gate*
Villager: AHHH! 
*The zombie pigman stabs the villager, he falls to the ground*
Zombie Pigman: MMM! ROAST BIGNOSED FOR ME TO EAT TONIGHT!
Steve: NOOOOOOOOO! *disconnects*
THE END
Villager: AHHHH! *punches zombie pigman away using pickaxe, and manages to lodge the pickaxe into the pigman, killing him instantly*
Steve: YES! THEY ARE STUCK *shoots arrow at one unfortunate zombie pigman through a hole*
Villager: Hey look some chests *points towards a few loot chests stationed in a room*
Steve and Villager: *look through the loot inside the chests*
Steve: A sadde? Gold! And gold sword... (ew) …
Villager: *grabs out an assortment of loot*
Steve: hey what’s this *grabs out an enchanted golden apple*
*flashback to beginning, where daniel tells Steve about beong careful with the apple…*
Villager: Well we just have to wait for a bit, the zombie pigman will forget about us soon.
*15 minutes later*
Villager: *interrupting steve* The pigmen forgot about us, let’s go back outside
Steve: okay *puts enchanted gold apple in inventory*
*Steve and Villager are sitting around in the room*
*Villager stands up and looks over the walls*
Villager: It looks like they are gone, lets go
*Villager breaks down the walls, and leaves the room, Steve follows*
Villager: Well, I guess we discovered most of what we can from here, so lets leave the fortress and do some more exploring
Steve: Ok then
*Steve and Villager search for a way out of the Nether Fortress*
Wither Skeleton: Boo
Steve: AHHHHHHH *immediately takes out diamond sword and lodges it right into the black skull*
Wither Skeleton: *tries to slash Steve with his stone sword and succeeds*
Steve: AH I DON’T FEEL SO GOOD *proceeds to swing one and twice, killing thw wither skeleton*
*the withering affect tries to kill Steve but-*
Steve: *starts binge eating cooked chicken while intense music plays*
Blaze: boo
Steve: AH!
Blaze: *sends a fire charge towards Steve but he dodges, the fire charge continues it's path, and the villager (not aware of the threat) tries out the eye of ender , it moves in front of Steve, the same time he dodges the charge, which makes contact with a thrown eye of ender, which starts to glitch out and makes a chain reaction*
KABOOOOOM!!!!
Blaze: *at the same time* wilhelm scream *and dies*
Steve: *blown back but sees the blaze rod on the ground* YES WE GOT HIM- WAIT WHAT THE-
Steve: Well what now?
Villager: Well from what I know, we are going to need to make a corrupted eye of ender
Steve: What?
Villager: You can make one from the eye of ender I crafted earlier *pulls out eye of ender*
Steve: Oh ya, but what can it even do?
VIllager: you can use it to make ender chests, your items get teleported through the chest.
Steve: ooooo
Villager: and you can also use it to locate the stronghold which is rumored to have a portal to another dimension
Steve: how do you use it to locate the stronghold?
Villager: So you throw the eye of ender like this *throws eye of ender, it drops back onto the ground near Steve, who picks it up*
Steve: Oh cool, I’m gonna try, *throws eye of ender*
KABOOM
*A fire charge has his the eye of ender, Steve and the Villager look back to see-*
Villager: A BLAZE
Steve: *shoots arrow at the blaze*
BLaze: *willhelm scream*
*the eye of ender continues to glitch in and out of existence with particles around it-*
Villager: What is it doing?
*the eye of ender finally stops, drops to the ground, with its color being red in the middle and orange everywhere, only a few of the edges of the pearl shows it's original color, it's as if the eye of ender and fire charge merged textures*
Villager: *picks it up* The eye of ender will show us the way to Herobrine like it did last time…
Steve: last time?
Villager: The other player, he had accidentally gotten his hands on this kind of pearl by setting an eye of ender on fire, which causes something impossible, or what we call it as, a glitch. The pearl was cursed with Herobrine’s scent, and the player was obsessed with finding herobrine, and opened the portal to the nether, where the eye led him to the castle, where he saw him… and he almost ended the overworld. Luckily, the villager battalion sent after him closed the portal and sacrificed themselves to save the world.
Steve: throw it, see what happens
Villager: *throws the pearl*
*the pearl instantly shakes aggressively, glows red, starts burning like a fire charge, and shoots it's way in one direction, before dropping onto the netherrack surface a 20 blocks away*
Villager: since a fire charge was mixed in with the eye of ender, it acts like a fire charge and eye of ender*
Steve: Let's follow it.
*Our heroes both travel through the nether using the (cursed) pearl*
*the background shows one villager skeleton wearing an iron helmet, when our heroes traverse further, more appear*
Steve: My god……….
Villager: I- I- this is it, we are getting closer. 
*our heroes see a nether brick gate, they go through, leading them through a tunnel, then onto a large detailed bridge made out of a combination of red and normal nether brick blocks.*
*3 wither skeletons guarding the bridge see Steve and the villager, one gets shot by Steve’s bow- the other two survive and charge*
Steve: Get behind me! *pulls out sword*
*Wither skeletons try to attack Steve but he ducks and backstabs one*
Steve: yessss, only one to go
Wither skeletons: tries to attack Steve but gets an arrow stuck into his head*
Steve: alright, let's go

*Herobrine doesn't finish his sentence because, he falls over, and smoke behind him reveals a red spy*
Steve: an enemy! *He stabs the red spy who falls to the ground, dead*
Steve: wow, that was easy, right?
Villager: *doesn't respond*
Steve: right?
Villager: *falls over*
*Behind him, the red spy appears, with an unusual hat on, holding the deadringer and an ambassador*
Steve: well, it was a good time while it lasted- *backstabbed*
*The Meet the Spy outro plays*

*Our heroes run through a gate into a area with nether brick statues, both walk through into Herobrines giant nether brick castle*
Steve: Woah, what is...oh. *Walk towards skulls placed near leather and iron helmets but stops*
*Both heroes reach a giant red nether brick door*
Steve: *tries to open the door* It seems to be locked
